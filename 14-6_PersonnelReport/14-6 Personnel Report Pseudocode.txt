function main
	Set random number generator
    
    Declare TimeOff workers[5]
	Initialize each instance with ID, name, and # of months worked:
		name - a literal string (assigned to char*)
		ID - 7 digits
		months worked - randomly generated number:
			worker 1 - rand()%13 - worked <=1 year,
			worker 2 - rand()%13+12 - worked >1 but <=2 years,
			and so on
    For each worker, 
		set # of used vacation days
			rand()%(20 * <# years worked>) - assuming a worker takes up to 20 vacation days a year
		set # of used sick leave days
			rand()%(15 * <# years worked>) - assuming a worker gets sick for up to 15 days a year
    call print(workers, 5) - to display data on workers in a table
    Change # months worked by worker[0]
    call print(workers, 5) - to display the table again and see changes on 1st worker

Function void print(workers [], size)  -  to display info on each worker's time off
    Display a table header:
		"Name", "ID", "Months", "Vacation Days: Earned | Used | Paid | Unpaid ", and "Sick Leave Days: Earned | Used | Paid | Unpaid"
	For each worker, determine # paid and unpaid vacation and sick leave days:
		short vacErnd, vacUsed, vacPaid, vacUnpd, sckErnd, sckUsed, sckPaid, sckUnpd
		vacErnd = <worker>.getMaxVac().<days>
		vacUsed = <worker>.getVac().<days>
		if vacErnd >= vacUsed, then vacPaid = vacUsed and vacUnpd=0,
			else vacPaid = vacErnd and vacUnpd = vacUsed-vacErnd
		sckErnd = <worker>.getMaxSick().<days>;
		sckUsed = <worker>.getSick().<days>;
		if sckErnd >= sckUsed, then sckPaid=sckUsed and sckUnpd = 0,
			else sckPaid=sckErnd and sckUnpd = sckUsed-sckErnd
    For each worker, display data in the table:
		<worker>.<name>, <worker>.<id>, <worker>.<months>, 
		<worker>.<vacErnd>, <worker>.<vacUsed>, <worker>.<vacPaid>, <worker>.<vacUnpd>,
		<worker>.<sckErnd>, <worker>.<sckUsed>, <worker>.<sckPaid>, <worker>.<sckUnpd>
