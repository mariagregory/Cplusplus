<p>My homeworks project for the "Intro Programming Concepts and Logic using C++" community college class.</p>

<h1><a href="Battleship%20Game/dist/Debug/Cygwin-Windows/battleship_game.exe?raw=true">PLAY BATTLESHIP</a> (2 players)</h1>
Try playing a text-based <a href="Battleship%20Game" title="Sea Battle on C++ console">Battleship Game</a>, written in C++ using NetBeans IDE.
<br/><em>(psst! If the game "freezes" after you type your name in the beginning, just restart it. I don't know why it keeps happening.)</em> <br/><p>Also, sometimes, it behaves strange, like the terminal window closes right after the last ship is sunk, while it behaves correctly in IDE. Please be patient, I am still learning.</p>
